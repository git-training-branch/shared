ED SHEERAN - PHOTOGRAPH

Loving can hurt, loving will hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel sad
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these photographs for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are always broken
And time's forever frozen still
