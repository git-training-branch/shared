warning sign - COLDPLAY

A warning signal
I missed the good part, then You realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell yeah what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning signed
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so
