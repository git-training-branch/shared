PARIS - SABRINA CARPENTER

If I ask that boy to sing, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took yourself where I think I should be
Someone told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Brazilian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like chocolate feeding me like medicine, yeah
